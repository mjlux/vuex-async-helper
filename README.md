# vuex-async-helper
vuex async helper function inspired by lmiller1990

In the search for a easy vuex async abstraction to get rid of the repetetive nature of state, mutations, actions and getters I stumbled upon [this article](https://medium.com/@lachlanmiller_52885/reducing-vuex-boilerplate-for-ajax-calls-1cd4a74cef26) by [lmiller1990](https://github.com/lmiller1990).

It inspired me to build up on his ideas and make it simpler and more versatile.
